## Abstract

The extraordinary growth rates of the data demand in mobile phones along with the finite nature of radio spectrum make radio spectrum a scarce and precious resource. In consequence, regulatory bodies and the industry continuously look for new ways to increase spectrum use efficiency and networks’ capacity. In this regard, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) proposed to switch from analogue to digital television, which reduced the spectrum needs for TV broadcasting and thus enabled to allocate part of the historically-used spectrum for TV, known as the digital dividend, to mobile communications systems.

Only a few years after the digital dividend (790-862 MHz) has been released, policy-makers are planning to undertake a second digital dividend to repurpose the 694-790 MHz band. To allocate this spectrum, regulators will need to design auctions that can guarantee that these frequencies are optimally used from both the social and business perspectives. Coverage obligations are the mechanism that policymakers use to force licensees to undertake infrastructure investments in the short run. This has been an extensively used legal mechanism to ensure certain social benefits from the private use of radio spectrum.

This Master Thesis contributes to the project ITRC- MISTRAL, a research consortium led by the University of Oxford (UK), that is exploring ways to improve the performance of infrastructure systems. In particular, this work focuses on the model MINERVA, which is a 5G model aiming to help policy-makers and telecom operators to assess the long-term benefits of their decisions.

The first objective of this work is the characterization of coverage obligations that policy-makers have forced telecom operators to fulfil and which were the success and challenges that they had in the development of the telecommunications infrastructure in the biggest European economies, particularly Spain, the UK, Germany and France. Secondly, this work has aimed to analyse how different coverage obligations would play out in the coming auction of the 700 MHz band. This band will be relevant for the rollout of future 5G telecommunication services. The subsequent analysis is focused on analysing the interest that operators would have in using this frequency band rather than higher frequencies bands.

The contributions to the project revolve around three main issues. First, the creation of a new capacity-expansion strategy, the «700 MHz densification», to test which is the maximum capacity that this frequency band could provide. Second, the creation of four coverage obligation options, which are defined based on the main characteristics of the obligations imposed by Spain, the UK, Germany and France. Third, the creation of a visualization module that presents the desired results of the model in several forms (Graphs, maps, csv files, etc.) to help users understand the simulation results and therefore the advantages and disadvantages of each coverage obligation alternative.

Finally, these contributions have been used to analyse the impact of the capacity-expansion strategies and the coverage obligations. First, the newly created «700 MHz densification» has been compared with the rest of strategies to determine its viability and suitability. Second, this work presents a study of the implications of the recently defined coverage obligations.
